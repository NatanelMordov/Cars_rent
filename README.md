This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started


First, run the server Tirmenal:

``` 
• ⁠npm install 
• npm install express
• ⁠npm install mysql2
• ⁠npm install cors
• ⁠node server.js
```

Then run the development Tirmenal:

```
• npm install 
• ⁠npm install next react react-dom
• ⁠npx next dev 
• ⁠npm run dev 
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
